2. Optimal Portfolio Allocation Recommendations:

Based on the analysis, an optimal portfolio allocation is recommended as follows:

AAPL: 30%
MSFT: 40%
GOOG: 30%
This allocation aims to balance the potential returns of each stock while mitigating portfolio risk, considering the correlation matrix and risk metrics.

3. Dynamic, Adaptable Investment Strategies:

Rebalancing: The portfolio will be rebalanced quarterly, or more frequently if market conditions warrant. Triggers for rebalancing include significant changes in volatility, sentiment, or correlation.
Market Volatility: During periods of high market volatility, the portfolio allocation will be shifted towards less volatile stocks (MSFT, GOOG) to mitigate risk.
Sentiment Shifts: Significant negative sentiment shifts for any stock will trigger a reduction in its allocation.
4. Risk-Adjusted Performance Projections:

(Include charts and graphs here. Example: A histogram showing potential portfolio returns based on different market scenarios, considering VaR/CVaR.)

Projected portfolio returns are estimated to range from [X%] to [Y%] over the next [timeframe]. These projections are based on various market scenarios and consider the calculated risk metrics (VaR/CVaR). It's crucial to understand that these are projections, and actual results may differ.

5. Actionable Portfolio Optimization Guidance:

Implementation: The recommended portfolio allocation will be implemented immediately.
Monitoring: The portfolio will be closely monitored for any significant changes in market conditions, volatility, or sentiment.
