In this groundbreaking experimental research, we propose a novel multi-agent system framework leveraging Google's Gemini language model, specifically focusing on its exceptional long-context capabilities to transform stock market portfolio management. By strategically deploying three specialized agents—Performance_Analyzer_Agent, Risk_Evaluator_Agent, and Advisor_Agent—each with distinct computational responsibilities, we aim to explore the transformative potential of large language models in complex financial decision-making processes. Our primary objective is to empirically investigate how a multi-agent system can effectively utilize Gemini's expansive context window, which enables comprehensive analysis of five years of stock market data, potentially overcoming traditional limitations in agent-based research. While acknowledging the inherent challenges of multi-agent systems, such as potential retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) latency, we hypothesize that Gemini's remarkable long-context prowess can mitigate these computational bottlenecks, offering a potentially paradigm-shifting approach to automated investment strategy development.
